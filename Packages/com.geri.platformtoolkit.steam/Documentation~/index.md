# Custom Steam Platform Toolkit

An open-source alternative to Unity's Steam Platform Toolkit extension.

This project provides a Steam integration that should mimic the official one.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration was developed with no reference from the original Steam integration. Therefore, this package doesn't
> promise 100% compatibility with Unity's Steam Platform Toolkit, but it should integrate perfectly with Platform
> Toolkit API.
