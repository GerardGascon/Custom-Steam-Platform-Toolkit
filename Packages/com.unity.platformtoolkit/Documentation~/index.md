# Platform Toolkit package

The Platform Toolkit package provides a single API with support for the following common platform systems and services:

* Account management
* Achievements
* Save data

By providing a single API, the package simplifies the integration of these common services into your application without rewriting your code for each platform. This allows you to target multiple platforms and meet submission and certification requirements at the same time.

The Platform Toolkit package provides a Unity Editor implementation to allow for testing these features in Editor Play mode, and Play Mode Controls to let you interact with the editor implementation.
