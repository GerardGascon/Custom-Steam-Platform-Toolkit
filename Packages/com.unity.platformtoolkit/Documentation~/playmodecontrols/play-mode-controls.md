# Play Mode Controls

Play Mode Controls allow you to test the features of the Platform Toolkit package in the Unity Editor. It provides a set of controls to simulate different platform behaviors and manage test accounts.

You can use Play Mode Controls to:

* Create and configure test accounts for use in Play mode.
* Simulate common failures, such as network issues or storage limitations.
* Manage save data and achievements for test accounts.
* Verify that your application correctly handles an unexpected user sign-out.
